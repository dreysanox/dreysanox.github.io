**Hello! I'm Drey**, a passionate cybersecurity student with a deep fascination for the inner workings of computer systems.

## My Security Journey

I specialize in **low-level system security** with particular focus on:
- 🧠 **Binary Exploitation**: Developing advanced exploitation techniques for CTF challenges and real-world vulnerabilities
- 🦠 **Malware Analysis**: Reverse engineering malicious software to understand attacker methodologies
- 🔐 **Cryptography**: Studying cryptographic primitives and their implementation weaknesses


Some future topics I will like to dive in are:
- 🐧 **Linux Internals**: Deep diving into kernel architecture, system calls, and security mechanisms
- 🕸️ **Web Security**: Exploring modern web application vulnerabilities and defense strategies

My approach combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice through:
- Solving CTF challenges. I participate in CTF competitions with my team Th3Grue
- Documenting my learning process through write-ups and blog posts where I can share what I learn
- Analyzing real malware samples in controlled environments
- Contributing to open-source security tools

## Current Focus Areas

### 🎯 Learning Goals
1. **Develop deep Linux kernel understanding**: Master process management, memory subsystems, and security modules
2. **Earn BSCP certification**: Validate my binary exploitation skills through certified expertise
3. **Master new PWN techniques**: Heap exploitation, kernel ROP chains
5. **Contribute to open-source security tools**: Enhance projects like Radare2, pwngdb, or create new utilities


## Why I Do This

> *"To understand is to perceive patterns"* - Isaiah Berlin

I believe true security understanding comes from seeing patterns across different domains - how memory corruption vulnerabilities relate to type confusion in script engines, or how cryptographic flaws mirror logic errors in smart contracts. This holistic approach allows me to connect concepts from kernel development to web application security, creating a comprehensive security mindset.
